# Socket Paint

Inspired by [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit)), socket paint is my excuse to learn Socket.io. Click a color on the palette to choose a color, then click the canvas to paint a pixel.  Other people can collaborate on your drawing! Such socket. Very multiplayer. Wow.
